# RockPaperScissors
Based on the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors I extended the game with the added options of a quick game (first to two) or a longer approach that lets you set the level at which you need to get in order to win the game.

The program uses basic concepts of OOP and introduces a player class, which tracks the player's xp and level.
The whole game mechanics are implemented in a separate class.

Hope you have fun playing!
